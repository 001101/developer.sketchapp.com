## Scripting API

With the release of version 40 of Sketch, we're continuing to (slowly) move towards rolling out our Javascript API as better way to work with the Sketch model from within your plugins.

As part of this work, we've updated this site to include a [API Reference](reference/api) section.

The API itself is still under development, and should not be regarded as completely fixed or ready for prime-time.

It's getting there however, and if you're starting to work on new plugins, you may want to consider trying it out. Over the next few releases we'll be developing it further, and also updating all of our [plugin examples](examples/) to use the API.
